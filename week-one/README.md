## Strings

Strings are used to hold data represented in text form. They can be of two main types (primitive or objects)
Strings that are primitives are specified using single or double quotes while strings objects are created using the constructor string().
String can be accessed, manipulated, modified and deleted. For that, there are many methods we can use.
Here are some string methods widely used:
-	charAt(): returns an individual character in a string . We can get an element of a given string by using its index in this way the elements of that string are treated are element of an array. 
return 'cat'[1] // returns "a"

Strings can be compared and there are methods for that.
String primitives and String objects can give different results when using eval() method. A string object can be converted to its primitive counterpart with the valueOf() method.
Sometime, we can get a very long string, we can break it according to two ways. We can use the + operator to join two strings together or use the” \” in order for that long string to continue to the next line.
